# Awesome Modrinth [![Awesome logo](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

**This is a collection of awesome open-source projects which use the Modrinth API in one way or another!** Use the generated table of contents to navigate, right next to where it says `README.md` just above. To avoid biases, all categories and entries within categories are sorted alphabetically (except for the [Miscellaneous](#miscellaneous) category).

Feel free to add your own project(s)—just fork and make a pull request! We suggest also adding the `modrinth` topic to your GitHub repository, if applicable. Want to get started on creating your own project using the Modrinth API? Check out our [documentation](https://docs.modrinth.com)!

*Note:* Simply because a project is on this list does not mean it is necessarily endorsed or official.
